# Data-Driven-Insights-on-Credit-Card-Spending-Behaviour

This project involves an end-to-end analysis of credit card data to uncover patterns in consumer spending behavior across major urban clusters in India.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Conducted an analysis on a real-world credit card transaction dataset (~20,000+)
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and city-level filtering for major urban clusters using Python.
- Segmented data by gender, card type, and spending categories.
- Applied statistical hypothesis testing (Chi-square test)for each of the major cities to uncover associations between:

  - Gender and Expenditure type
  - Credit card type and Expenditure type
- Designed a data visualization report using **Power BI**:
  - Multi-page visualizations for city-wise insights
  - Visualizations segmented by gender, card type, and year
